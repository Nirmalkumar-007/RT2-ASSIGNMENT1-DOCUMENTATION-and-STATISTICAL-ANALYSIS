- This assignment is done using Doxygen. [DOXYGEN](https://doxygen.nl/) is a documentation generator and static analysis tool for software source trees.

-  The first assignment consists of the documentation of the user interface of  RESEARCH TRACK 1 [(3rd assignment)](https://github.com/Nirmalkumar-007/RESEARCH-TRACK-ASSIGNMENT-3).

- The [DOCS](https://github.com/Nirmalkumar-007/RT2-ASSIGNMENT1-DOCUMENTATION/tree/master/DOCS) file consists of the documentation of code in the following formats [Latex](https://github.com/Nirmalkumar-007/RT2-ASSIGNMENT1-DOCUMENTATION/tree/master/DOCS/latex), [html](https://github.com/Nirmalkumar-007/RT2-ASSIGNMENT1-DOCUMENTATION/tree/master/DOCS/html) and [xml](https://github.com/Nirmalkumar-007/RT2-ASSIGNMENT1-DOCUMENTATION/tree/master/DOCS/xml).

###  **DOCUMENTATION**
#####  **GENERAL COMMENT  FOR THE ENTIRE CODE**
Usually, Doxygen is the standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources. So the code of RESEARCH TRACK 1 [(3rd assignment)](https://github.com/Nirmalkumar-007/RESEARCH-TRACK-ASSIGNMENT-3) is being commented to execute the documentation by using a specific format.

   
    /**
     * \file  : The description of the file needs to be commented
     * \brief : Brief description of the code is commented 
     * \author: NIRMAL KUMAR RAVIKUMAR 5168055
     * \Entire code is being commented 
    **/

#####  **DOXYWIZARD**
 Doxywizard is used for creating and editing configuration files that are used by doxygen. Doxywizard consists of a single executable that, when started, pops up a window.

After entering the details in the doxywizard then the Doxygen executes the files documentation in the preferred format. The documented output of the code is being stored in the file [DOCS](https://github.com/Nirmalkumar-007/RT2-ASSIGNMENT1-DOCUMENTATION/tree/master/DOCS). The DOCS file consists of the documentation of code in the following formats [Latex](https://github.com/Nirmalkumar-007/RT2-ASSIGNMENT1-DOCUMENTATION/tree/master/DOCS/latex), [html](https://github.com/Nirmalkumar-007/RT2-ASSIGNMENT1-DOCUMENTATION/tree/master/DOCS/html) and [xml](https://github.com/Nirmalkumar-007/RT2-ASSIGNMENT1-DOCUMENTATION/tree/master/DOCS/xml).
